Dropt "CanvasPixel" opt "Pix" in calls 
usage‬ &or examples are for purchase  
& make way too 3dbrew, with brewery parts?

(Lady Zurich) v1.2 log 
dept generic for 
and added "mappable" from --> ../../kennyd-lee/ctru-pas-1.0.0/blob/master/3ds/allocator.inc

Engines name space &or their Device Context Handles, moved outside to new "savage" includes
 TemplateLoadHDC, TemplateFreeHDC see notes in tycob.h &or our ../DESK 

(Lady Zurich) v1.3 log 
add GSP_FramebufferFormats --> ../Parx-Pas/blob/master/parx_inf.inc
append FloodFill --> ./include/Parx_Fill.h & ./source/Parx_Fill.c
append PalletFormats & 
Github::mtheall use of pallet context handling of  
bppixel, rgb2pixel, pixel2rgba 
  
 (Lady Zurich) v1.4 log (untested)
cleaned some defines moving code closer to portibal 
append ParxLCD enum --> RefParx()
append RefParx function & MaxWidth in headers
fixed ordering of Top,Left,Height,Width, --> SetRecEx()


 (Lady Zurich) v1.5 log 
append lineSample, EllipseSample functions --> ./include/Parx_Buffer.h & ./source/Parx_Buffer.c & parx_inf.inc


R&D ForSale parx.pas --> PSetPix, BSetPix functions based on 
                    24bit RGB, TopRawLinear & BotRawLinear {Public Retraction!! faster than the C based code counterparts. Results @ 78 milliseconds when PSetPix, BSetPix are used from C, are not in &or on display as photos of this! I'll add when their use is near & looped locally in pascal there is an even playing field End OF Retraction!!}

R&D ForSale ParxPlus.pas --> GfxPix & GfxPixB Rastar &or !far version of a Left, Right & Bottom Maps @ 16.4 million colours @ 60 million 3DS sold @ 2nd most widely used computer language$ for the development of $cience & application$.  

in theory a "Pascal sub-system enabled Canvas-GDI" does merit and could rival, Pica200 with OpenGL pushing ?
